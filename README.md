## 1. Introduction

Generally, searching for an image in a set database is typically done through something known as Content-Based Imaged Retrieval (CBIR). Content-Based Image Retrieval works with the image itself rather than assigning specific text or data to it to search for it. Earlier CBIR systems identified a certain image by its description of visual characteristics like color, shape, texture, and other significant physical details. In 2015, an idea was proposed to use Radon barcode for image retrieval system in the medical field [3]. This was inspired by the many other products that use barcodes in some shape or form. Radon barcode is binary code that is generated by Radon Transformation and uses projection angles to tag an image. Using Radon barcodes is much more efficient than previous Content-Based Image Retrieval methods since it is a lot easier to search for specific images using Hamming distance. Hamming distance between two-bit strings that are equal length is the number of positions where corresponding bits are different, thus the images that are most like one another have the lowest Hamming distance.
